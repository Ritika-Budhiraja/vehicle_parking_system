# Import all models here to make them available when importing from models package
# This makes imports like "from models import Admin" work

from models.admin import Admin
from models.user import User
from models.parking_lot import ParkingLot
from models.parking_spot import ParkingSpot
from models.booking import Booking

# You can add any shared model functionality here if needed
